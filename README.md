# NASSCOMM-VSD-Soc-Design-Program
Welcome to the Digital VLSI Soc Design and Planning Program conducted by VLSI SYSTEM DESIGN.This programs gives a overview of RTL to GDSII glow through rigorous lab exercises with hands on experience in physical design using Open Source EDA tools to students.

## DAY 1
### Overview of QFN-48 Chip,Pads,Core,Die and IP's
The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-lead) package is a surface-mount integrated circuit (IC) package with 48 pins. It is commonly used for applications requiring a small form factor, excellent thermal performance, and efficient electrical connections.

### Fundamental Terminologies related to structure and development of Integtaed Circuit
1.Core:
* The core of chip refers to functional logic of IC/chip.
* By functional logic I mean it includes combinational logic,sequental logic,memory,ALU and many more which help in data computation and processing.
* Core is typically surrounded by pads and clock distribution network.
2.Pads:
